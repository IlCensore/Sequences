What Do We Mean By 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Rationality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We mean:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\noun on
Epistemic rationality
\noun default
: believing, and updating on evidence, so as to systematically improve the
 correspondence between your map and the territory.
 The art of obtaining beliefs that correspond to reality as closely as possible.
 This correspondence is commonly termed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

truth
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

accuracy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and we're happy to call it that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\noun on
Instrumental rationality
\noun default
: achieving your values.
 Not necessarily 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

your values
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the sense of being 
\emph on
selfish
\emph default
 values or 
\emph on
unshared
\emph default
 values: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

your values
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means 
\emph on
anything you care about
\emph default
.
 The art of choosing actions that steer the future toward outcomes ranked
 higher in your preferences.
 On LW we sometimes refer to this as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

winning
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If that seems like a perfectly good definition, you can stop reading here;
 otherwise continue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes experimental psychologists uncover human reasoning that seems
 very strange - for example, someone rates the probability 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bill plays jazz
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as 
\emph on
less
\emph default
 than the probability 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bill is an accountant who plays jazz
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This seems like an odd judgment, since any particular jazz-playing accountant
 is obviously a jazz player.
 But to what higher vantage point do we appeal in saying that the judgment
 is 
\emph on
wrong
\emph default
?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experimental psychologists use two gold standards: 
\emph on
probability theory
\emph default
, and 
\emph on
decision theory
\emph default
.
 Since it is a universal law of probability theory that 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(A\right)\geq P\left(A\,\&\, B\right)$
\end_inset

, the judgment 
\emph on
P
\emph default
(
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bill plays jazz
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) < 
\emph on
P
\emph default
(
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bill plays jazz
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 & 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bill is accountant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) is labeled incorrect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To keep it technical, you would say that this probability judgment is 
\emph on
non-Bayesian
\emph default
.
 Beliefs that conform to a coherent probability distribution, and decisions
 that maximize the probabilistic expectation of a coherent utility function,
 are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bayesian
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This does not quite exhaust the problem of what is meant in practice by
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rationality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, for two major reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, the Bayesian formalisms in their full form are computationally intractabl
e on most real-world problems.
 No one can 
\emph on
actually
\emph default
 calculate and obey the math, any more than you can predict the stock market
 by calculating the movements of quarks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is why we have a whole site called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Less Wrong
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, rather than simply stating the formal axioms and being done.
 There's a whole further art to finding the truth and accomplishing value
 
\emph on
from inside a human mind
\emph default
: we have to learn our own flaws, overcome our biases, prevent ourselves
 from self-deceiving, get ourselves into good emotional shape to confront
 the truth and do what needs doing, etcetera etcetera and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, sometimes the meaning of the math itself is called into question.
 The exact rules of probability theory are called into question by e.g.
 anthropic problems in which the number of observers is uncertain.
 The exact rules of decision theory are called into question by e.g.
 Newcomblike problems in which other agents may predict your decision before
 it happens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In cases like these, it is futile to try to settle the problem by coming
 up with some new definition of the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rational
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and saying, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Therefore my preferred answer, 
\emph on
by definition
\emph default
, is what is meant by the word `rational'.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This simply begs the question of why anyone should pay attention to your
 definition.
 We aren't interested in probability theory because it is the holy word
 handed down from Laplace.
 We're interested in Bayesian-style belief-updating (with Occam priors)
 because we expect that this style of thinking gets us systematically closer
 to, you know, 
\emph on
accuracy
\emph default
, the map that reflects the territory.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then there are questions of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How to think
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that seem not quite answered by either probability theory or decision theory
 -- like the question of how to feel about the truth once we have it.

\end_inset

 Here again, trying to define 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rationality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a particular way doesn't support an answer, merely presume it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the 
\emph on
Twelve Virtues of Rationality
\emph default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\size footnotesize
How can you improve your conception of rationality? Not by saying to yourself,
 “It is my duty to be rational.” By this you only enshrine your mistaken
 conception.
 Perhaps your conception of rationality is that it is rational to believe
 the words of the Great Teacher, and the Great Teacher says, “The sky is
 green,” and you look up at the sky and see blue.
 If you think: “It may look like the sky is blue, but rationality is to
 believe the words of the Great Teacher,” you lose a chance to discover
 your mistake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\size footnotesize
Do not ask whether it is “the Way” to do this or that.
 Ask whether the sky is blue or green.
 If you speak overmuch of the Way you will not attain it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\size footnotesize
You may try to name the highest principle with names such as “the map that
 reflects the territory” or “experience of success and failure” or “Bayesian
 decision theory”.
 But perhaps you describe incorrectly the nameless virtue.
 How will you discover your mistake? Not by comparing your description to
 itself, but by comparing it to that which you did not name.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are not here to argue the meaning of a word,

 not even if that word is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 The point of attaching sequences of letters to particular concepts is to

 -- to help transport thoughts from one mind to another.
 You cannot change reality, or prove the thought, by manipulating which
 meanings go with which words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So if you understand what concept we are 
\emph on
generally getting
\emph default
 at with this word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rationality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and with the sub-terms 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

epistemic rationality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

instrumental rationality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we 
\emph on
have communicated
\emph default
: we have accomplished everything there is to accomplish by talking about
 how to define 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rationality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 What's left to discuss is not 
\emph on
what meaning
\emph default

\emph on
what is a good way to think

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With that said, you should be aware that many of us will regard as 
\emph on
controversial
\emph default
 -- at the very least -- any construal of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rationality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that makes it 
\emph on
non-normative
\emph default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if you say, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The rational belief is X, but the true belief is Y
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 then you are probably using the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rational
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in a way that means something other than what most of us have in mind.
 (E.g.
 some of us expect 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rationality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to be 
\emph on
consistent under reflection
\emph default
 -- 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rationally
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 looking at the evidence, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rationally
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 considering how your mind processes the evidence, shouldn't lead to two
 different conclusions.) Similarly, if you find yourself saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The rational thing to do is X, but the right thing to do is Y
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 then you are almost certainly using one of the words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rational
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

right
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in a way that a huge chunk of readers won't agree with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case -- or in any other case where controversy threatens -- you
 should substitute more specific language:

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

X is rational!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is usually just a more strident way of saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think X is true
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think X is good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So why have an additional word for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rational
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? Because we want to talk about 
\emph on
systematic methods
\emph default
 for obtaining truth and winning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rational
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has potential pitfalls, but there are plenty of non-borderline cases where
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rational
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 works fine to 
\emph on
communicate
\emph default
 what one is getting at, likewise "irrational".
 In these cases we're not afraid to use it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet one should also be careful not to 
\emph on
overuse
\emph default
 that word.
 One receives no points merely for pronouncing it loudly.
 If you speak overmuch of the Way you will not attain it.
